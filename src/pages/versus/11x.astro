                <FAQ summary="How does Dream differ from 11x?">
                    While 11x uses LLMs to lightly personalize emails to prospects from basic LinkedIn-style searches, Dream offers much more. Dream's advanced research engine finds highly targeted prospects at the optimal point in their buying cycle, enabling the creation of deeply personalized, research-driven content. Plus, Dream is multi-modal, supporting outbound methods beyond just email.

                <FAQ summary="What makes Dream's AI SDR more effective than 11x's solution in generating qualified leads?">
                    Dream's AI SDR is more effective than 11x's solution because it leverages deep, detailed research on both the customer and individual prospects. While 11x operates with the same basic context as a standard SDR—focusing mainly on your product—Dream's advanced research engine gathers up-to-date information around the clock. This continuous research enables Dream to identify highly targeted prospects at the perfect moment in their buying cycle. As a result, you can engage prospects with personalized, timely outreach, such as contacting an office manager right when they announce a new office opening. This level of personalization leads to significantly higher open rates and conversions compared to the lightly personalized emails generated by 11x.

                <FAQ summary="In what ways does Dream provide a more personalized customer experience than 11x?">
                    Dream provides a more personalized customer experience than 11x by enabling sales teams to research and target high-value prospects individually, rather than relying on mass email campaigns. While 11x offers basic personalization, Dream's advanced research capabilities allow for deep insights into each prospect and their company. Additionally, Dream features deeper sales agent profiling, which adjusts messaging based on both the sender and the receiver. This dual personalization ensures that communications are highly relevant and engaging, leading to more meaningful interactions and greater opportunities for market expansion.

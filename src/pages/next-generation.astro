                <p>The first generation of AI SDRs were big on promise, showcasing features that performed well in demos. But they all relied on similar technology to early ChatGPT models, meaning frequent hallucinations and light touch personalisation. </p>
                <p>Where the first generation can best be thought of as a fresh-faced junior sales hire straight out of their high-school exams, second generation sales agents are a hardened sales manager who can take anything that's thrown at them. Relying on cutting-edge technology like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet, these agents fully deliver on the future of sales AI, holding convincing conversations without any human intervention.</p>
                <p>Dream delivers on the promise of sales AI, offering you more context and more intelligence through better technology.</p>

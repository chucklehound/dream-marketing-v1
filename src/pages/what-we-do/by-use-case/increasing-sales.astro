              Sales hires are expensive and many companies leverage SDRs and
              other frontline sales professionals to send outbound
              communications to potential customers.

              With Dream, companies that want to grow through outbound sales

              <li>
                Agents use email and LinkedIn to outreach, reply to and book
                meetings with prospects.

          <p>
            Swoop help small businesses around the world find the right finance
            providers. They work with accountants and CPAs to make this happen.

            Before Dream, outbound was impossible to manage with their target
            customer being difficult to find.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dream allowed Swoop to partner their expert team of Account
            Executives with AI Sales Agents in multiple geographies, increasing
            their top-of-funnel overnight.

						Marketplaces face a unique growth challenge: they must manage both supply and demand. Unlike single-sided businesses, marketplaces require sales and engagement efforts for two distinct customer sets—often with vastly different needs. Worse still, the dynamic nature of marketplaces means constant product adjustments, requiring ongoing re-engagement of both sides.
					</p>
					<p>
						This creates a massive reliance on sales teams, account managers, and customer success reps—sending countless emails and engaging in manual outreach to stay competitive. Dream eliminates this bottleneck by automating sales and re-engagement at scale, freeing marketplaces to focus on growth.

								<h3>Why This Problem is Critical for Marketplaces</h3>
								<p>
									If marketplaces don’t address the inefficiencies in managing supply and demand, customer acquisition costs (CAC) skyrocket while customer lifetime value (LTV) plummets. The result? Struggles to compete, particularly for larger, international marketplaces where operations span regions and customer sets.
								</p>								
								<p>
									Dream’s AI-powered sales agents solve this by automating personalized outreach and dynamic re-engagement, reducing costs while boosting engagement and retention.

					<h2>Discover New Market Potential Without the Overhead</h2>
					<p>
						For SaaS businesses and marketplaces, testing a new market is often a daunting process. Traditionally, expanding into a new region requires hiring a General Manager (GM) and building a sales team, even before knowing if the effort will succeed. The cost, time, and resources involved make testing new markets a significant risk.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dream changes the equation. With Dream’s AI-powered sales agents, companies can quickly and cost-effectively test new markets by deploying virtual sales teams. You can evaluate demand, test outbound techniques, and adapt buying triggers to new regions—without the need to hire full-time staff.

								<h3>The Challenge of Testing New Markets</h3>
								<p>
									Expanding into a new market comes with significant challenges:
								</p>								
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>High Upfront Costs</strong>
										<p>Hiring a GM, sales reps, and supporting staff before seeing ROI.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Unknown Market Dynamics</strong>
										<p>Determining whether existing outbound strategies and buying triggers will translate to a new geography.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Long Lead Times</strong>
										<p>Setting up a team, training them, and waiting for results delays critical business decisions.</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Without an efficient way to test new markets, businesses risk overcommitting resources or missing out on potential opportunities.</p>

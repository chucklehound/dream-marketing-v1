						Scaling revenue in SaaS businesses often comes with

						By automating outbound sales, tracking critical buying

								<h3>The SaaS Scaling Challenge</h3>
								<p>
									For SaaS companies, revenue growth has
									traditionally been tied to headcount growth.
									This model presents several challenges:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>High Costs</strong>: Hiring and
										training sales teams takes time and
										resources, with many SDRs
										underperforming or failing probation.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Limited Scalability</strong>:
										Without expensive tools and dedicated
										RevOps teams, scaling outreach remains
										difficult.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Missed Opportunities</strong>:
										Traditional sales tools rely on basic
										LinkedIn searches, missing key buying
										signals and potential leads.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									The result? Growth becomes unpredictable,
									slow, and costly.

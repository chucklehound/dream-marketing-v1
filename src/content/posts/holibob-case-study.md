### Introduction  
In the competitive travel tech space, growth depends on reaching the right partners at the right time. **Holibob**, a company helping travel brands sell tours and experiences, struggled to prioritise outbound sales. With Dream, that changed.

### About Holibob  
Holibob works with tourism boards, operators, and niche providers to improve experience sales. Their clients range from global travel brands to local operators looking to connect with more travellers. Holibob’s platform helps:  
- Increase visibility of tours and attractions.  
- Drive ancillary revenue for travel brands.  
- Streamline distribution of experiences to new customers.  

### The Challenge: Limited Bandwidth for Outreach  
For co-founder **Angus Hardy**, the challenge was clear. Outbound sales were vital, but between product development, partnerships, and fundraising, the team simply didn’t have the hours to dedicate to consistent outreach. Without dedicated sales staff, a key growth channel was underdeveloped.  

### The Solution: Dream Head of Sales on Autopilot  
Dream’s **Head of Sales** now runs Holibob’s outbound campaigns from start to finish:  
- Identifying potential partners in the travel industry.  
- Finding and verifying the right contacts.  
- Personalising email outreach.  
- Generating warm leads and booked calls.  

The result is a sales pipeline that runs on autopilot, freeing Angus and his team to focus on closing deals and building partnerships.  

### The Results: A New Growth Channel in Travel  
Dream didn’t just fill Holibob’s pipeline—it unlocked new sectors. For example, Dream created a tailored campaign targeting **airlines**, showing how Holibob can drive ancillary revenue through experiences. This opened an entirely new vertical the team hadn’t had the time to pursue.  

As Angus says: *“It’s opening up a whole new channel of growth.”*  

### Looking Ahead  
Holibob sees its next opportunity in marketing. A **Dream Marketing Manager** could generate consistent campaigns, highlight product wins, and keep the brand visible in the fast-moving travel industry. For now, Dream ensures Holibob never misses a growth opportunity—even in sectors they hadn’t considered before.

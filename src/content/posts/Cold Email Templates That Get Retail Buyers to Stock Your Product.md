Cold emailing is a powerful tool for F\&B brands looking to secure retail partnerships, especially in competitive markets. Done well, it can help you achieve response rates in the mid-teens and open rates of up to 90%. Even when buyers don’t respond immediately, a well-crafted email can build brand recognition and leave a lasting impression.

This article explores how to write effective cold emails tailored to retail buyers, covering everything from subject lines and preview text to call-to-action (CTA) strategies. You’ll also find ready-to-use templates designed for both small and large retailers.

## Why Subject Lines Are Critical

Your **subject line** is the first thing a buyer sees and determines whether your email gets opened or ignored. A great subject line is engaging, specific, and targeted to the recipient. Dream can help personalize at scale.

#### **Tips for Crafting Subject Lines**

* **Make It Buyer-Specific**: Include something unique to the recipient, such as their location or store focus.  
  * Example: “The Best Biscuits in Norfolk” for a buyer in Norwich.  
* **Highlight Your Product’s Value**: Focus on what makes your product unique or appealing.  
  * Example: “Award-Winning Vegan Snacks Your Customers Will Love.”  
* **Avoid Generic or Clickbaity Lines**: Retail buyers can spot mass emails.  
  * Bad: “Our New Product\!”  
  * Bad: “Must-See Snacks for 2024\!”

## The Preview Text is Key

Preview text is the first few lines of your email and appears in Gmail, Outlook, and other inboxes right after the subject line. This is your second opportunity to hook the buyer, so make it count.

If you’re wondering how to personalize preview text at scale, take a look at Dream.

#### **How to Use Preview Text Effectively**

* **Lead with Value**: Make your first sentence something immediately interesting.  
  * Example: “Hi Mark – Our gluten-free cookies are a top seller in \[Region\] and perfect for \[Retailer Name\].”  
* **Avoid Generic Pleasantries**: Skip “I hope this finds you well.” Instead, personalize if needed:  
  * Example: “I hope all is well in \[Location\].”  
* **Tease Your Offer**: Hint at samples, benefits, or success stories.  
  * Example: “We’d love to send you samples of our best-selling vegan snacks.”

## Why Cold Email Works in FMCG

Cold email isn’t just for high-volume industries like SaaS—it’s an effective strategy for F\&B brands, even with lower outreach volumes. Here’s why:

* **High Open and Response Rates**: With personalization and relevance, 5-15% response rates and high open rates (70-90%) are achievable.  
* **Brand Recognition**: Even if buyers don’t respond immediately, consistent and well-crafted emails build familiarity with your brand.  
* **Cost-Effective**: Cold email is a scalable way to connect with buyers without the overhead of in-person visits or large sales teams.

## Crafting the Perfect Call-to-Action (CTA)

Your CTA determines whether the buyer takes the next step. A good CTA is specific, relevant, and easy to act on.

#### **Effective CTA Examples**

* **Offer Samples**: “Can we send you samples of our best-selling gluten-free cookies?”  
* **Propose a Quick Call**: “Would you have 10 minutes next week to discuss this?”  
* **Focus on Their Goals**: “Let’s explore how we can help you meet growing demand for organic snacks.”

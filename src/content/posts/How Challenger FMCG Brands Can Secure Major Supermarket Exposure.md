## How Dream Can Help Challenger Brands Target Retail Buyers Everywhere

The FMCG retail landscape isn’t limited to the major supermarket chains. Smaller retailers, regional chains, and niche stores often provide challenger brands with faster entry points and meaningful opportunities to grow. At the same time, breaking into major supermarkets requires precision targeting to identify the right buyers within vast, complex organizations. **Dream** makes it possible to do both.

#### **Targeting Smaller Retailers at Scale**

* **Efficient Prospecting**: Dream enables you to identify and categorize thousands of small and regional retailers based on location, product focus, and customer demographic.  
* **Personalized Outreach**: Create tailored messages for boutique stores, local grocers, and regional distributors, showing how your product aligns with their customer base.  
* **Localized Messaging**: Dream supports outreach in multiple languages, making it ideal for expanding into international markets or connecting with culturally specific audiences.

#### **Reaching the Right Buyers in Major Supermarkets**

* **Buyer Identification**: Major supermarket chains have complex buying teams, often divided by region, category, or product type. Dream helps pinpoint the exact buyers responsible for your category, whether it’s the account manager for “ambient snacks” or the regional buyer for “beverages in the North.”  
* **Hyper-Targeted Campaigns**: Dream allows you to segment your outreach based on the retailer’s focus—ensuring your pitch resonates with their current goals, whether that’s sustainability, innovation, or affordability.  
* **Scalable Follow-Ups**: Dream automates follow-up sequences, increasing your chances of securing a response without manual effort.

#### **Saving Time and Resources**

* Instead of spending countless hours manually researching buyers or sending generic outreach, Dream’s AI-driven platform streamlines the process.  
* Scale your outreach while maintaining personalization, ensuring your brand stands out in both small retailers and major chains.

With Dream, challenger brands can navigate the entire retail ecosystem—from small independents to the biggest supermarket groups—effectively and efficiently. It’s your ultimate tool for securing shelf space wherever your products belong.

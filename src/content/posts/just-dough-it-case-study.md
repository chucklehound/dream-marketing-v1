### Introduction  
Running a food business is tough enough without the added challenge of chasing new customers. For **Just Dough It**, a premium pizza kit supplier to hospitality venues across the UK, growth was limited by one thing: time. Founder **Will Cowley** needed a way to scale sales outreach without losing focus on operations. That’s when he turned to **Dream**.

### About Just Dough It  
Just Dough It helps pubs, golf clubs, theatres, and other venues deliver restaurant-quality pizza without needing chefs. Each kit contains everything required for a fresh, stone-baked style pizza—without the overhead of hiring specialist kitchen staff.  

It’s a compelling model for venues looking to add food revenue without operational complexity. Once a venue signs up, they become a recurring customer, making every new sale even more valuable.

### The Challenge: Sales Outreach at Scale  
Before Dream, Will was stuck. He knew hundreds of venues could benefit from his kits, but reaching them all felt impossible:  
- **No time for outreach** while balancing a growing business.  
- **Sales pipeline stalled** because outreach felt too daunting.  
- **Risk of plateauing growth** without consistent new customer acquisition.  

Like many small business owners, Will wore multiple hats—product development, logistics, customer service. Sales often fell to the bottom of the list, even though it was the key driver of growth.  

### The Solution: A Head of Sales That Never Sleeps  
With Dream’s **Head of Sales**, Just Dough It built a powerful outbound engine:  
- Automated email outreach to thousands of potential venues nationwide.  
- Messaging tailored to hospitality operators, from golf clubs to theatres.  
- Consistent follow-up that kept Just Dough It top-of-mind.  

Will puts it plainly: *“It’s genuinely generated every customer I have—it’s crazy!”*  

### The Results: From Side Project to Full-Time Business  
Dream transformed Just Dough It from a side hustle into a full-time company. The steady flow of new customers allowed Will to quit his 9-5 job and focus fully on growing the business. Today, Just Dough It supplies venues across the UK, with a reliable stream of new accounts joining each month.  

### Extra Benefits: Personal Insights on Tap  
Beyond sales, Will also uses Dream’s **Personal Assistant**. Each week, he receives a reminder of which customers are behind their usual schedule of ordering. That small change has prevented lost revenue and strengthened customer relationships—something that would have been impossible to track manually.

### Looking Ahead  
The next big leap? Automating finance. Will is eagerly awaiting Dream’s upcoming **Finance Manager**, which will handle invoicing and payments with the same reliability Dream brought to sales.  

For him, Dream isn’t just a tool—it’s a growth partner.

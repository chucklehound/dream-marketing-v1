### Introduction  
Fundraising should be simple, but scaling outreach to thousands of businesses is a daunting task. **GiveWheel**, a platform that helps companies and individuals run multi-charity fundraising campaigns, needed a smarter way to grow its corporate base. Enter **Dream**.

### About GiveWheel  
GiveWheel enables companies to support the causes their employees care about—without drowning in admin. The platform integrates fundraising across multiple charities, making it easy to:  
- Launch company-wide giving campaigns.  
- Support individual challenges like sponsored rides or runs.  
- Track impact across multiple causes.  

It’s a win-win for companies who want to empower their staff to give back, while avoiding the usual complexity of managing multiple charity partnerships.

### The Challenge: Too Many Prospects, Too Little Time  
Founder **Charlie Hart** knew corporate partnerships were key to growth. But reaching thousands of businesses with personalised messages while running the platform day-to-day wasn’t feasible. The team needed to:  
- **Personalise outreach at scale.**  
- **Keep the sales pipeline moving.**  
- **Stay top-of-mind** when CSR initiatives arise.  

Without extra headcount, outbound sales was almost impossible to maintain consistently.

### The Solution: Dream’s Head of Sales  
GiveWheel adopted Dream’s **Head of Sales**, which quickly became Charlie’s “second brain.” It now:  
- Sources companies likely to run fundraising campaigns.  
- Finds the right decision-makers and verifies contact details.  
- Handles the outreach and follow-up sequence end to end.  
- Keeps warm leads active with timely reminders.  

This consistent process has freed the team to focus on product development while ensuring new opportunities keep flowing.

### The Results: From Reactive to Proactive Growth  
Dream shifted GiveWheel from a reactive sales strategy to a **proactive outbound engine**. Old leads, some over three months stale, were re-engaged with nurturing campaigns. The result? A wave of new conversations that would have otherwise been lost.  

As Charlie explains: *“It’s taken us from reactive to proactive in sales—without hiring.”*  

### Looking Ahead  
Next, GiveWheel hopes for a **Customer Success Manager** Dreamie—one that can respond to client queries and automatically create FAQs. This would help the team continue scaling without drowning in support requests.  

For now, Dream ensures GiveWheel stays visible to the right companies at the right time.
